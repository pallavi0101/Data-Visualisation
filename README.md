1.4.	Analysis 

We have done the analysis based on our research questions. Through the various Dashboards we will try to analyse our dataset and gain some meaningful insights. 

Design Choices:

•	Line charts have been used to create visualisation where data was showing a period of years and to represent various countries.
•	The stacked charts (area charts) are used for depicting the composition of gases throughout the recorded history.
•	Bubble and Tree map has been used to show a graphical representation of high emitters and high food producers.
•	Use of geographical maps to show distribution of emission and production throughout the world.
•	Animated scatter plots to show increase in emission levels with the passing of years.
•	Embedded charts to display comparison among various emission intensities.
•	Bar charts to compare GDP values with countries Emission levels. 


Choice of Colours:

•	A colour scheme of blue, green and red has been used across charts as it represents the agricultural & emission levels. The use of red colour to draw attention to specific areas which need attention.
•	The numbers have been coloured and increased in size appropriately to draw attention to details.
•	Across all charts the unneeded information has been removed or mutated to draw attention to only specific details.
•	The charts are plotted against a white background to reduce unnecessary visual noise.

Dashboard 1 

















According to the given information from Dashboard 1, the highlighted red colour on the upper left layer is pointing out China is the highest carbon emissions releasing country in the globe, where is taking about 27.5 % of the total carbon emissions from each year. 
Apart from that, food emissions are taking up to 26% of the overall greenhouse emissions matter. In fact, there are 50% of the habitable land is used for the purpose of agriculture.
In the lower section, data is showing that agriculture is playing a main role in greenhouse emissions, where there were 12 billion tonnes of GHG had released into atmosphere by the year of 2016. There is also a graph on the lower right, where showing the breakdown green emissions level from agriculture sectors and the figures are continuously and positivity growing to a larger amount.
